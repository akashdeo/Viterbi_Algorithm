# Viterbi_Algorithm

HMM Decoding: Viterbi Algorithm:

Programmatically implement the Viterbi algorithm and run it with the HMM in
Figure 1 to compute the most likely weather sequence and probability for a given
observation sequence. Example observation sequences: 331, 122313, 331123312, etc.

For Figure 1, please look in HMM.png
